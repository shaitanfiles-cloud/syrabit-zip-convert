# Cloudflare Pages — Syrabit Frontend Deploy

These are the canonical Cloudflare Pages settings for the Syrabit frontend
(`syrabit.ai`). The backend lives separately on Railway as `api.syrabit.ai`
and is **not** deployed via Pages.

## Dashboard settings

| Setting                    | Value                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Production branch**      | `main`                                                               |
| **Framework preset**       | `None` (custom)                                                      |
| **Root directory** (Project) | `/` (repo root — pnpm monorepo root, do **not** set to `artifacts/syrabit`) |
| **Build command**          | See below                                                            |
| **Build output directory** | `artifacts/syrabit/dist` &nbsp; ← **no leading slash**                |
| **Node.js version**        | `20` or `22`                                                         |

### Build command

Scope the install + build to the Syrabit frontend and its workspace
dependencies only — do **not** install the entire monorepo (the backend,
mockup sandbox, and unrelated artifacts inflate the install to ~30 minutes
and pull in Playwright/Puppeteer browser downloads we don't need at the
edge):

```sh
corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@10.26.1 --activate \
  && pnpm install --filter @workspace/syrabit... --frozen-lockfile \
  && pnpm --filter @workspace/syrabit run build
```

The `--filter @workspace/syrabit...` syntax (with the trailing `...`)
includes the package itself plus all of its workspace dependencies, but
nothing else. The `catalog:` protocol is resolved by pnpm against the root
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` and works correctly under `--filter`.

## Required environment variables (Pages → Settings → Environment variables)

Set these on the **Production** environment. They are baked into the
build output, so you must trigger a fresh deploy after changing them.

| Variable                   | Example                  | Purpose                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`                 | `production`             | Vite production mode                                        |
| `VITE_BACKEND_URL`         | `https://api.syrabit.ai` | Backend FastAPI base URL                                    |
| `VITE_GA4_ID`              | `G-XXXXXXXXXX`           | GA4 measurement ID. **Must** match `^G-[A-Z0-9]{6,12}$` — anything else (legacy UA-*, numeric account ID, blank) is silently dropped and `gtag` never loads. |
| `VITE_CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`  | (optional)               | Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon token                       |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` | `1`              | Skip Chromium download — frontend bundle never runs Playwright |
| `PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD`  | `1`                      | Skip Puppeteer Chromium download                            |

## DO NOT set on Pages

These are **backend / Worker secrets only**. Setting them on the Pages
project leaks them into public build logs and is a real security incident:

- `CF_ANALYTICS_API_TOKEN` — backend reads CF Analytics GraphQL with this
- `CF_ZONE_ID` — backend-only
- `D1_SYNC_SECRET`, `EDGE_WORKER_URL`
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Any `ADMIN_*`, `RAZORPAY_*`, `RESEND_*`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, etc.

If any of the above were ever set on Pages, **rotate them immediately** in
their source-of-truth provider (Cloudflare API tokens dashboard, Supabase,
Razorpay, etc.) and remove them from Pages env vars.

## Static asset wiring (verified to land in `dist/`)

The following files in `artifacts/syrabit/public/` are copied verbatim by
Vite into `artifacts/syrabit/dist/` and served directly by Pages:

- `_redirects` — SPA fallback (`/* /index.html 200`). Combined with
  `_worker.js` to also serve a 200 for HEAD navigation probes.
- `_headers` — long cache for `/assets/*`, `/fonts/*`, hashed PWA icons;
  `max-age=0, must-revalidate` for `index.html`, `sw.js`, and the PWA
  precache manifest; short s-maxage for HTML routes.
- `_routes.json` — tells the Pages Worker which paths to forward to the
  Worker (`include: ["/*"]`) vs. serve as static (sitemaps, robots.txt,
  PWA icons, RSS feeds, etc.).
- `_worker.js` — SPA fallback Worker (Task #365): GET + HEAD on unknown
  paths return `index.html` with a 200 so crawlers see real HTML.

After deploy, smoke-test:

```sh
curl -sI https://syrabit.ai/library/some-slug | head -1   # HTTP/2 200
curl -sI https://syrabit.ai/assets/<hashed>.js | grep -i cache-control   # immutable
curl -sI https://syrabit.ai/index.html | grep -i cache-control            # max-age=0
curl -sI -X HEAD https://syrabit.ai/random/spa/path | head -1             # HTTP/2 200
```

## Expected build time

After the changes above, the Pages build should complete in **< 5
minutes** (down from ~34 minutes). If it ever regresses, check:

1. The build command no longer scopes to `@workspace/syrabit...`.
2. A new transitive dependency added a heavy postinstall (e.g. native
   compile, Chromium download). Add the corresponding skip env var to
   the Pages project.
3. Lockfile drift forced `pnpm install` off the frozen path.
