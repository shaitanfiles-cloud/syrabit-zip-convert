"""Task #750 — Surface the Trustpilot AggregateRating JSON-LD verifier
result on the admin dashboard.

The build-time inject step (Task #748) and the daily scheduled verifier
(`.github/workflows/trustpilot-jsonld-prod.yml`) already protect SERP
star coverage — but failures only land in GitHub Actions email, which
the non-engineering ops/marketing team doesn't watch. This module
exposes a tiny store/serve pair so the verifier can ship its per-URL
result table to the same admin dashboard the team already checks for
delivery + alert health.

Endpoints
---------
* ``POST /api/admin/trustpilot-jsonld/report`` — webhook the scheduled
  workflow (and any future on-demand runs) calls with the JSON the
  verifier produced via ``--json-out=<path>``. Authenticated by the
  shared ``TRUSTPILOT_REFRESH_SECRET`` header (same secret already used
  by the aggregate refresh webhook in ``routes/config.py``) so we don't
  need to provision/leak a second secret. The latest report replaces
  the previous one — we only care about the most recent run.

* ``GET /api/admin/trustpilot-jsonld/report`` — admin-protected read
  used by the AdminHealth tile. Returns ``{configured: false, ...}``
  when no report has been ingested yet so the UI can show a clear
  "no data" state instead of an error.

Storage
-------
A single Mongo doc keyed by ``_id="trustpilot_jsonld_verifier_report"``
in ``db.api_config`` (the same collection ``routes/admin_monetization.py``
uses for similar telemetry rows). One doc, replaced atomically — the
admin tile reads it for the current pass/fail snapshot.

Task #754 — alongside the "latest" doc we also append every run to the
``trustpilot_jsonld_runs`` collection (TTL-indexed on ``ts`` for 30 days)
so the dashboard tile can render a sparkline of pass-rate over the
trailing month and ops can spot a slow-moving regression (e.g. a single
URL failing 3 days in a row) before it bites SERP coverage. The ``ts``
field is a real ``datetime`` (not the ISO string we keep on the latest
doc) because Mongo's TTL monitor only honours BSON dates.

# Motivation: Task #753's regression alert dedups per-URL once it flips
# PASS→FAIL — so a URL that silently keeps failing day after day only
# pages ops once, on day 1. That's correct for high-churn regressions
# but wrong for slow-moving ones (the whole reason Task #754 added the
# 30-day history). This detector escalates: when a URL has failed
# ``_STREAK_THRESHOLD`` consecutive runs AND we haven't yet paged on
# this particular streak, fire one streak alert. The streak ledger
# lives on the same canonical doc as the existing per-URL dedup ledger
# (``alertedStreaks``), so no extra collection is needed.
