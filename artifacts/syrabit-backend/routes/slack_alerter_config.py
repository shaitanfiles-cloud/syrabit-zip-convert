"""Task #969 — shared Slack-alerter config helper for cron silence
alerters.

Three sibling cron silence-alerter modules — ``admin_logs_cf_pull_silence_alerts``,
``admin_cf_waf_drift_cron_alerts``, and ``admin_edge_proxy_deploy_cron_alerts`` —
each fan out their "cron has gone silent / recovered" pages to a
dedicated Slack incoming webhook gated on a per-alerter env var.
Their public health endpoints surface a small ``slackConfigured`` /
``slackWebhookEnv`` pair so the AdminHealth dashboard can render a
"Slack ✓ / ✗" badge next to the cron pill (Task #964).

Before this module existed, each alerter defined its own private
``_slack_webhook_url`` helper plus ``_CRON_SLACK_WEBHOOK_ENV``
constant, and Task #964 had to copy the same ``slackConfigured`` /
``slackWebhookEnv`` block into each. Worse, ``admin_health.py``
needed to surface the same pair on the edge-proxy-deploy cron pill
(which lives in ``admin_health`` itself, not in the alerter module),
and a module-level import of those private symbols would have re-
introduced the circular import the alerter→admin_health dependency
already creates — so it had to do a per-request late import of
``_slack_webhook_url`` and ``_CRON_SLACK_WEBHOOK_ENV`` from the
alerter module.

This module collapses both: every alerter and every health endpoint
calls into :func:`slack_config_for` (and, for posting, into
:func:`slack_webhook_url_for`) keyed on the env-var name. The env-var
names themselves are also re-exported here so admin_health.py can
import them directly without reaching into a sibling module that
already imports back into it.

The webhook URL itself is intentionally never returned by
:func:`slack_config_for` — only the boolean configured-ness and the
env-var name — so admin-readable JSON surfaces never leak the URL.
