"""Task #882 — AdminHealth pill for the edge-proxy-deploy CI workflow.

The ``edge-proxy-deploy`` GitHub Actions workflow
(``.github/workflows/edge-proxy-deploy.yml``) runs unattended on every
push to master that touches ``workers/edge-proxy/**``. Its
``smoke-preview`` job is the canonical signal that the latest worker
build still passes the burst / D1 / KV / bot-cache checks the
``smoke:preview`` script exercises (see replit.md § "Cloudflare
Workers edge-proxy"). When that job goes red the only current signal
is a red badge in the GitHub Actions UI — the AdminHealth dashboard
that on-call already keeps open is silent.

This module surfaces the latest run via the same cron-pill convention
as the Trustpilot / cf-waf-drift pills (Task #751, Task #831). The
shape returned here intentionally differs from those two: this cron
does NOT post a heartbeat to the backend (no point — the GitHub
Actions REST API is the source of truth for whether the workflow ran
and what it concluded), so we hit
``/repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/workflows/edge-proxy-deploy.yml/runs?per_page=1``
and translate the response into the
``healthy/silent/degraded/never_observed/not_configured`` status keys
the shared ``<CronHealthPill>`` component understands. Concretely:

* ``conclusion == "failure"`` → ``silent`` (red) — the smoke job
  regressed and on-call should look right now.
* run age > 7 days → ``degraded`` (amber) — deploys this rare are
  themselves suspicious (the workflow only fires on
  ``workers/edge-proxy/**`` pushes, but a 7-day silent gap usually
  means master hasn't moved, which is the signal we want to see).
* otherwise (``success``, in-progress, queued) → ``healthy``.
* No runs returned → ``never_observed``.
* ``GITHUB_REPO`` not set → ``not_configured`` (mirrors
  ``routes.admin_ci_status`` so the same setup hint can render).

The configuration env vars are deliberately the same as
``routes.admin_ci_status`` (``GITHUB_REPO``, ``GITHUB_TOKEN``) so a
single PAT covers every admin GitHub-Actions surface; the workflow
file name is overridable via ``EDGE_PROXY_DEPLOY_WORKFLOW`` in case
someone renames it but otherwise defaults to
``edge-proxy-deploy.yml``. Failures to reach GitHub are surfaced via
``error`` so the UI can render "status temporarily unavailable"
rather than going blank — same defensive shape as
``admin_ci_status``.

Task #DIAGNOSTICS: Added /admin/diagnostics endpoint to provide system
health overview including LLM provider status, database pool health,
cache hit rates, and last D1 sync timestamp.

# ``edge_proxy_deploy_cron_alert_state``. That state was previously
# only visible by querying Mongo directly, so admins seeing a red
# pill couldn't tell whether on-call had already been paged (and the
# alerter is in its 24h debounce window) or whether the page is
# still pending. The endpoint below surfaces the lock doc next to
# the pill so the dashboard can render that distinction inline.
#
# The same helper is reused by the cf-waf-drift and Trustpilot
# alert-state endpoints (defined alongside their own pill routes —
# see ``routes.admin_cf_waf_drift_cron_alerts`` and
# ``routes.admin_trustpilot_cron_alerts``) so all three admin

# has been broken steadily for a week. Task #918 adds a tiny audit-log
# Mongo collection (``cron_alert_history``) that every alerter appends
# to on every page + recovery, plus three thin GET endpoints (one per
# pill) so the AdminHealth dashboard can render a "show paged history"
# panel without admins having to dig through Slack logs.
#
# Schema is intentionally flat (one doc per event, indexed by
# ``lock_id`` + ``created_at``) so the same collection serves all
# three pills and a future pill (Task #905+) only has to call the
# shared ``record_cron_alert_event`` helper. The recording side is
# best-effort and never raises (it's already running inside the
# alerter's "fire-and-forget" notification block); the read side
# always returns 200 with an empty ``events`` list when Mongo is down
# or the alerter has never fired (mirrors the ``/alert-state``
# defensive contract so the dashboard never crashes on infra hiccups).

#
# Surface the latest ``cloudflare-weekly-audit.yml`` run on the admin health
# panel so teams see pass/warn/fail counts without navigating to GitHub.
#
# Strategy for the summary counts:
#   • The run ``conclusion`` ("success"/"failure") tells us whether any FAIL
#     occurred, but not the individual PASS/WARN/FAIL/PLAN_REQUIRED totals.
#   • The detailed counts live in the ``cf-audit-report-<run_id>`` artifact
#     (a ZIP containing cf-audit-report.json written by cloudflare-full-audit.js).
#   • We download and parse that ZIP with a short timeout and cache the result
#     in Redis (keyed by run_id) for 4 hours so repeated dashboard loads are
#     cheap.  If the download fails we return ``summary: null`` and the card
#     degrades to showing only the run status / age.
#
# Stale threshold: 8 days (the workflow runs weekly; a gap longer than this
# means the schedule broke or the workflow was disabled — shown as amber).
