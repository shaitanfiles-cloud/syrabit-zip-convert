"""Cloudflare vs. Google/Bing webmaster-tools cross-check (Task #316).

The per-UA report in `cf_bot_report.py` classifies Cloudflare verified-bot
requests by user-agent. To prove those numbers are trustworthy, the
weekly Googlebot / Bingbot totals need to be cross-checked against
Google Search Console (GSC) and Bing Webmaster Tools (BWT) crawl-stats
for the same ISO week. If the two diverge by more than
`DIVERGENCE_THRESHOLD`, the bucket patterns or filters need adjusting.

### Why a JSON sidecar instead of direct GSC/BWT API calls?

Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools both require
property-scoped OAuth consent tokens that the Syrabit deploy doesn't
currently hold (no `GSC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` / `BWT_API_KEY` secret). Rather
than block the cross-check on a credentials rollout, the cross-check
reads a small operator-maintained JSON file keyed by ISO week. The
operator drops in the GSC and BWT totals once per week from the two
consoles, the weekly loop picks them up automatically, and the
comparison table is rendered alongside the main report. When/if
Syrabit wires in the GSC/BWT APIs, only `load_external_totals` needs
to change — the rest of this module is pure.

### Systematic-gap note

Cloudflare counts every *HTTP request* from a verified search bot —
including static assets (CSS/JS/images) a crawler fetches while
rendering a page. Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools report
*crawl operations* against the property, which is closer to "URL
discovery + HTML fetches" and typically *smaller* than the Cloudflare
number. A 10–30% gap is therefore expected and is documented in the
rendered cross-check section so future readers don't misread the delta
as a classification bug.

### File format

`external-crawler-totals.json` lives beside the dated markdown drops
(default `.local/reports/external-crawler-totals.json`; overridable via
`CF_BOT_REPORT_DIR`). Shape:

```json
{
  "source": "Operator copy/paste from GSC + BWT",
  "weeks": {
