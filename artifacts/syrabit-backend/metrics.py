    Called from `auth_deps.rate_limit_chat_optional` whenever a device

    """Compute the admin-chart payload for `chat.anon_quota_exhausted`.

    The chart's headline KPIs (``daily``, ``unique_devices_exhausted``,
    ``signup_after_exhaust``, ``conversion_pct``) are read from Redis
    so that numerator and denominator come from the **same**
    cross-worker source. Mixing per-worker counts with cross-worker
    counts in a multi-gunicorn deployment can otherwise produce
    inflated and unstable conversion rates (including >100%) depending
    on which worker serves this endpoint.

    Source of truth:
      • denominator (``unique_devices_exhausted``, ``daily``) — sum of
        ``ZCARD chat:anon_exhausted_devices:<day>`` across the window
      • numerator (``signup_after_exhaust``)               — sum of
        ``SCARD chat:anon_signup_after_exhaust_devices:<day>``

    Conversion semantics: this is **window-level** conversion, not
    cohort-by-exhaustion-day conversion. The numerator buckets the
    signup by *signup day*, so a device that exhausts on day N at
    23:00 and signs up on day N+1 at 02:00 (still inside the 24h
    code-level join) is counted in day N+1's signup bucket but day
    N's exhaustion bucket. For the headline window-aggregated
    ratio this is exactly what we want; if the dashboard later
    needs per-day cohort fidelity (`% of day-N cohort that
    converted within 24h`) the numerator key would have to switch
    to exhaustion-day. Documented here so the chart copy stays
    honest and the next iteration knows what to change.

    The in-memory rolling window is still used for the by-hour /
    by-day-of-week distributions (which are sub-views and acceptable
    as per-worker samples), and as a fallback when Redis is offline.
    The ``data_source`` field in the payload tells the dashboard
    whether it is showing fully cross-worker data or the degraded
    single-worker view.
