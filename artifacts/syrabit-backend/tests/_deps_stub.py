"""Shared test helper: install a fully-populated stub `deps` module.

The backend's `deps` module exports many top-level names (db, redis_client,
security, logger, supa, pg_pool, pwd_ctx, is_mongo_available,
mark_mongo_down, sarvam_*, _assert_not_cms_context, …) and pulling in the
real one at test-collection time triggers Mongo/Redis/Postgres connection
attempts.

Several test files therefore install a *stub* `deps` module via
`sys.modules["deps"] = stub_module` before importing the code under test.
The historical implementations only set `db` and `is_mongo_available`, so
when pytest later collected another test file whose import chain ran
`from deps import security, redis_client, logger ...` (via auth_deps),
the import failed with `cannot import name 'security' from 'deps'
(unknown location)` — sys.modules pollution from the first test broke
collection for everyone after it.

This helper centralises the stub and ensures it carries every name any
production module is known to import from `deps`. Call once at module
import time of a test that does not want the real deps.

Task #469 hardening
-------------------
The stub `db` is no longer a bare ``MagicMock``. Bare MagicMocks
auto-create child mocks of type ``MagicMock`` for any attribute, which
means a call like ``await db.indic_sanitize_runs.insert_one({...})``
raises ``TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await'
expression`` because the return value is a non-awaitable MagicMock. This
is exactly what caused two ``test_ai_chat_indic_route.py`` failures in
Task #467 — a polluting earlier test had let production code call an
async motor method on the stub, the resulting MagicMock got cached on
the collection, and every later test inherited it.

We replace the bare ``MagicMock`` with ``_MotorDbMock``, a MagicMock
subclass whose attribute access yields ``_MotorCollectionMock``
instances. ``_MotorCollectionMock`` is itself a MagicMock subclass that
returns ``AsyncMock`` for any name in ``_ASYNC_MOTOR_METHODS`` (the
canonical list of motor.AsyncIOMotorCollection async APIs we use).
Result: ``await db.<anything>.insert_one(...)`` always works, no matter
what ordering pytest collects tests in.

The stub also exposes a ``_is_syrabit_test_stub = True`` marker so the
conftest autouse fixture can recognise the stub (versus the real
``deps`` module that production may have imported) and reset its mock
call history between tests without disturbing real state.
