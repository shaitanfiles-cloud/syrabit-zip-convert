"""Regression guard for Task #774 / Task #784.

The cross-test pollution fix in ``tests/_deps_stub.py::install_deps_stub``
relies on an *in-place mutation* contract: when ``force=True`` is called
on an already-installed synthetic stub, the helper MUST mutate that
existing module object instead of constructing a fresh
``types.ModuleType("deps")`` and swapping ``sys.modules`` to it.

If a future "simplification" reverts the helper to building a new
module each call, then any route module that previously bound names
via ``from deps import db, security, ...`` at import time will keep
pointing at the *old* module, while a test's local ``import deps``
resolves to the *new* one. Tests then have to monkeypatch BOTH —
exactly the divergence Task #774 eliminated.

This file fails immediately if that contract is broken.
