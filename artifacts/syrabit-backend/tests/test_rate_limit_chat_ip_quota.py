"""Task #793 — production wiring tests for the device-keyed daily quota
in ``auth_deps.rate_limit_chat_optional``.

Replaces the original Task #768 IP-keyed test. The free-tier 30/day
budget is now keyed on a signed HttpOnly device-token cookie minted
by :mod:`device_token` so that AHSEC/SEBA students sharing an egress
IP (Jio/Airtel CGNAT, school WiFi, hostel/cyber-café) each get their
own private 30/day pool. The IP is kept only as a coarse abuse cap.

What we cover here:

* the same device cookie is capped at 30/day end-to-end (route ↔
  Lua deduct ↔ Redis counter);
* two different device cookies sharing one public IP each get their
  own full 30/day budget — the original CGNAT/school-WiFi failure
  mode is no longer reachable;
* a request that arrives without a cookie still succeeds *and* gets
  a fresh signed cookie issued in the response — never produces a
  hard 429 on the very first visit;
* the coarse per-IP cap fires only at the much higher
  ``IP_COARSE_DAILY_CAP`` threshold (not at 30);
* IP-extraction prefers ``cf-connecting-ip`` over ``x-forwarded-for``
  over ``request.client.host`` so quota counters key on the real
  client IP and not on the worker's egress.

The fail-closed-without-Redis case (Task #768) is preserved at the
end so we don't silently regress that availability tradeoff.
