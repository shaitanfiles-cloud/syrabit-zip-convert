"""Syrabit.ai — shared URL / host safety primitives.

Every outbound HTTP fetch in the backend (the educational reader, the
grounded-answer RAG pipeline, the generic web-content scraper) must run
through the same SSRF defences:

* Reject IP literals that land in private / loopback / link-local /
  reserved / multicast / unspecified space.
* Reject hostnames on the operator / hard-deny allowlist.
* Re-resolve every FQDN so a public-looking name that A/AAAA-records
  into private space is rejected *before* the first TCP connect.
* Follow redirects manually and re-run the full check on every hop —
  httpx's ``follow_redirects=True`` is a known SSRF sink because a
  hostile upstream can 302 us into an internal IP.

Prior to Task #616 these helpers lived as private (`_`-prefixed)
functions on ``edu_reader`` and were imported across module boundaries
by reaching into another module's "private" namespace. That made the
coupling invisible and the helpers awkward to unit-test in isolation.
This module is the single, public home for the rules; ``edu_reader``,
``rag``, and ``web_content`` all import from here.

Public API
----------
* ``validate_host_for_ssrf(host)`` → ``(ok, reason)``
* ``safe_get_with_redirects(client, url, *, max_hops=5, headers=None)``
  → ``(response, final_url, reason)``
* ``resolves_to_public_ip(host)`` → ``(ok, reason)`` (exposed so the
  reader's robots-fetch path can reuse the DNS guard without
  re-implementing it).
