<h2>How Syra AI Works</h2>
<p>Syra is the AI tutor built into Syrabit.ai. It is designed specifically for Assam Board exam preparation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Syllabus-Grounded Answers:</strong> Syra uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve relevant chapter content before generating a response. Every answer is grounded in actual syllabus material — not generic internet knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Subject Support:</strong> Students can ask questions about any subject and topic in their enrolled curriculum. Syra identifies the relevant board, subject, and chapter automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Exam-Focused:</strong> Responses include exam tips, mark allocations, and important distinctions frequently tested in Assam Board exams.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Guards:</strong> Syra explicitly declines questions outside the student's syllabus to prevent misinformation and keep study sessions focused.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Makes Syrabit Unique</h2>
<p>Syrabit is not another generic study app. It is purpose-built for a specific student population (Assam Board) with capabilities that most educational platforms lack:</p>

<div class="section-grid">
<div class="grid-card">
<h3>Zero-Hallucination AI Tutor</h3>
<p>Unlike generic AI chatbots, Syra refuses to answer questions outside the student's syllabus. It uses a multi-stage RAG pipeline with relevance gating to ensure every answer is grounded in actual chapter content. If the system cannot find relevant material with high confidence, it explicitly declines rather than making something up.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid-card">
<h3>5-Provider LLM Failover</h3>
<p>No single point of AI failure. The system uses a multi-provider cascade — if one AI provider is slow or unavailable, it automatically fails over to the next in milliseconds. Multiple independent providers ensure students almost never experience AI downtime. Each provider has independent timeout controls.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid-card">
<h3>Syllabus-Native Architecture</h3>
<p>The entire database schema is structured around the Assam education system: Board → Class/Semester → Stream/Course Type → Subject → Chapter → Topic. The system supports NEP FYUGP course types (AEC, SEC, MDC, VAC, GE) that most platforms don't even know exist. An automated PDF syllabus importer can parse official university documents into this hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid-card">
<h3>Chat-to-Content Pipeline</h3>
<p>High-quality AI chat answers can be "promoted" into permanent QA pairs by admins. These QA pairs are automatically grouped by topic and published as structured FAQ pages with Schema.org markup — turning student conversations into SEO-indexed study material.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid-card">
<h3>Real-Time Web Search Fallback</h3>
<p>When internal RAG content isn't sufficient, Syra uses a custom web crawler (SyrabitBot) with Playwright for JavaScript-rendered pages and Trafilatura for clean text extraction. It can even fetch and extract text from online PDFs in real-time during a conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid-card">
<h3>Sarvam AI Voice Integration</h3>
<p>Built-in text-to-speech with support for Assamese, Hindi, and English using multiple Indian voice speakers. TTS responses are cached to minimize latency. Translation and transliteration between major Indian languages is also supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid-card">
<h3>Intelligent Content Analytics</h3>
<p>Custom session tracking with visitor and session IDs measures page counts, bounce rates, and session duration. Library interaction analytics track specific events (AI clicks, subject views, search queries) to identify content gaps and student needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid-card">
<h3>Academic Personalization</h3>
<p>Onboarding captures each student's board, class, stream, and course type. The dashboard, library, and AI tutor are personalized to show only content relevant to the student's enrolled curriculum — no information overload from other boards or classes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Content Quality &amp; Editorial Process</h2>
<p>Content on Syrabit follows a rigorous editorial process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content is prepared by subject-matter contributors familiar with Assam Board curricula</li>
<li>Every page is cross-referenced with the official AHSEC, SEBA, or university syllabus</li>
<li>Content is reviewed for factual accuracy, exam relevance, and academic depth</li>
<li>Each study note follows a structured format: formal definitions, detailed explanations, solved examples, exam tips, and practice questions with model answers</li>

<h3>AI &amp; RAG Pipeline — How Syra Answers Questions</h3>
<p>Syra is not a generic chatbot. It uses a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline specifically designed to prevent hallucination and keep answers within the student's syllabus:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Syllabus Matching:</strong> When a student asks a question, the system first identifies which board (AHSEC/SEBA/Degree), subject, and chapter the question relates to. This uses semantic similarity matching against pre-embedded syllabus topics and chapter headings.</li>
<li><strong>Content Retrieval:</strong> The RAG engine retrieves the most relevant chapter sections using vector similarity search. A relevance gate ensures only high-quality matches are used — if no content passes the confidence threshold, Syra declines the question rather than hallucinating.</li>
<li><strong>Reranking:</strong> Retrieved content chunks are reranked using a dedicated reranking model to prioritize the most exam-relevant sections before they are passed to the language model.</li>
<li><strong>Topic-Aware Extraction:</strong> A fuzzy heading matcher extracts the precise topic section from chapter content — not just the first N characters, but the actual section about the queried topic (e.g., extracting the "Personality and Dresses of Yogi" section from a Yoga chapter, not the etymology section that happens to appear first).</li>
<li><strong>Grounded Generation:</strong> The extracted syllabus content is injected into the LLM prompt as grounding context. The prompt includes strict instructions to answer only from the provided content, cite chapter references, and include exam tips.</li>
<li><strong>Out-of-Syllabus Guard:</strong> If a question falls outside the student's enrolled syllabus, Syra explicitly declines with a helpful message — preventing misinformation. This guard is only relaxed when there is a confirmed high-confidence syllabus topic match.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Multi-Provider LLM Failover</h3>
<p>Syrabit does not depend on a single AI provider. The system uses an ordered cascade of multiple LLM providers that automatically fails over if one provider is down, rate-limited, or slow. The cascade includes India-optimized models for low latency, ultra-fast inference providers, and high-quality general-purpose models as fallbacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each provider slot has independent timeout controls for fast failover</li>
<li>If a provider fails or is too slow, the system instantly moves to the next provider</li>
<li>Students almost never experience AI downtime — all providers must fail simultaneously</li>
<li>The provider selection is optimized for the Indian student use case, prioritizing low-latency models first</li>
</ul>

<h3>Content Generation &amp; Quality Pipeline</h3>
<p>Study material on Syrabit is not manually typed — it goes through a structured AI-assisted content pipeline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Syllabus Ingestion:</strong> Official board syllabi (AHSEC, SEBA, university FYUGP) are parsed into structured subject → chapter → topic hierarchies and stored in MongoDB.</li>
<li><strong>Document Upload &amp; Chunking:</strong> Textbook PDFs and reference materials are uploaded, chunked, and indexed. Each chunk is embedded using vector embeddings for later retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>AI Content Generation:</strong> For each topic, the system generates study notes following a strict format: formal definition → detailed explanation → solved examples with Assam-specific context → exam tips → practice questions with model answers.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Scoring:</strong> Generated content is scored on completeness, syllabus alignment, and factual accuracy. Content below the quality threshold is flagged for regeneration or manual review.</li>
<li><strong>SEO Optimization:</strong> Published content is automatically wrapped in SEO-optimized HTML with Schema.org structured data (Article, LearningResource, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList), OpenGraph tags, and geo-targeting meta tags for Assam.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Format Publishing:</strong> Each topic can be published as multiple page types — notes, definitions, MCQs, important questions, solved examples — each with its own optimized template and structured data.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Semantic Search &amp; Syllabus Embeddings</h3>
<p>Syrabit uses vector embeddings for intelligent content discovery:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Syllabus Embedding:</strong> Every chapter heading and topic name across all boards is embedded as vectors. When a student asks a question, the query is compared against these embeddings to identify the relevant subject and chapter — even if the student phrases the question differently from the textbook heading.</li>
<li><strong>Fuzzy Topic Matching:</strong> A fuzzy matching system maps student queries to exact syllabus topics. This handles variations in naming (e.g., "Yogini dress" matches "Personality and Dresses of Yogi") that pure keyword search would miss.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance Gating:</strong> The system uses multiple configurable similarity thresholds to ensure only genuinely relevant content is retrieved. Below-threshold queries are declined rather than answered with irrelevant material.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voice &amp; Multilingual Services</h3>
<p>Many students in Assam are more comfortable in Assamese or Hindi than English. Syrabit integrates voice and language services for Indian language accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> AI responses and study notes can be read aloud in Assamese, Hindi, and English with multiple Indian voice speakers. Audio is cached to reduce latency on repeat plays. Configurable pace, pitch, and loudness.</li>
<li><strong>Translation:</strong> Content can be translated between major Indian languages including Assamese, Hindi, Bengali, and English.</li>
<li><strong>Transliteration:</strong> Script conversion between Devanagari, Assamese, Bengali, and Latin scripts.</li>
<li><strong>India-Optimized LLM:</strong> The primary language model is trained on Indian content for better comprehension of mixed-language queries (English + Assamese/Hindi).</li>
</ul>

<h3>SEO &amp; Crawler Architecture</h3>
<p>Syrabit uses a dual-rendering architecture to serve both students and search engines optimally:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bot Detection Middleware:</strong> A middleware layer detects Googlebot, GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Bingbot, and other crawlers by user-agent. Detected bots receive fully pre-rendered HTML with Schema.org structured data, while regular users get the fast SPA experience.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Rendered HTML:</strong> Each subject landing page and topic page has a complete HTML representation with full meta tags (OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, geo-targeting, citation metadata), structured data (Article, LearningResource, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, Course), and clean semantic HTML.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic OG Images:</strong> Subject pages serve subject-specific thumbnail images as OpenGraph images for WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter link previews — not generic placeholder images.</li>
<li><strong>Segmented Sitemaps:</strong> The sitemap is split by content type (notes, MCQs, definitions, examples, important questions) with per-page priority scoring and last-modified timestamps, following the sitemaps.org protocol.</li>
<li><strong>llms.txt:</strong> A machine-readable plain-text description file at <code>/llms.txt</code> provides AI systems with structured information about the platform, its content, and URL patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance &amp; Reliability</h3>
<p>Syrabit is optimized for students on slow mobile networks (2G/3G) and low-end Android devices common in rural Assam:</p>

<h4>Multi-Layer Caching</h4>
<p>Syrabit uses a 4-layer caching architecture to minimize latency and database load:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>L1 — In-Memory Cache:</strong> Process-local TTL caches for user sessions, RAG results, syllabus data, and AI responses. Fastest access, no network hop.</li>
<li><strong>L2 — Distributed Redis Cache:</strong> Shared cache layer for content responses, LLM response deduplication (reduces AI costs), and rate-limit state.</li>
<li><strong>L3 — CDN + Service Worker:</strong> Static assets served via CDN. A service worker provides offline support with network-first strategy for dynamic content and cache-first for images. AI streaming routes are explicitly bypassed.</li>
<li><strong>L4 — Bot HTML Cache:</strong> Pre-rendered HTML for crawler requests is cached permanently per worker — repeated bot visits never trigger database queries.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Frontend Performance</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Splitting:</strong> All major page components are loaded on-demand, not upfront — reducing initial bundle size.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Chunk Splitting:</strong> Third-party libraries are split into separate cached chunks so framework updates don't invalidate the entire bundle.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Prefetching:</strong> Critical pages are prefetched during browser idle time. API responses are prefetched on user intent signals (hover, navigation).</li>
<li><strong>Server State Management:</strong> Intelligent client-side caching eliminates redundant API calls when navigating between pages.</li>
<li><strong>Compression:</strong> GZip compression on all API responses. Modern image formats (WebP) for visual assets.</li>
</ul>

<h4>AI Response Performance</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Streaming Responses:</strong> AI chat responses stream tokens in real-time as they are generated. Students see the first word within seconds, not waiting for the full response to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel Fetching:</strong> RAG context retrieval, web search, and conversation history are fetched in parallel — significantly reducing total latency compared to sequential fetching.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Failover:</strong> Each LLM provider in the failover chain has independent timeouts. If a provider is slow, the system moves to the next provider within seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Thinking Indicator:</strong> A UI component shows students that the AI is "thinking" (retrieving content, searching) — reducing perceived latency even on slow connections.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reliability</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Worker Concurrency:</strong> Gunicorn runs multiple async workers — if one worker is processing a slow AI request, other workers continue serving fast requests.</li>
<li><strong>Graceful Degradation:</strong> If all LLM providers fail, the system returns a clear error message. If the database is temporarily unavailable, cached content continues to serve.</li>
<li><strong>Credit &amp; Rate Limiting:</strong> Per-user credit tracking with configurable daily limits prevents abuse while ensuring fair access. Rate limiting via Redis protects against excessive API usage.</li>
<li><strong>Database Indexing:</strong> Critical MongoDB indexes (text search, unique constraints, compound keys) are created on startup to ensure fast queries even as content grows.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Google OAuth 2.0 — no passwords stored on Syrabit servers.</li>
<li><strong>Security Headers:</strong> Comprehensive security headers on all responses including CSP, frame protection, referrer policy, and XSS protection.</li>
<li><strong>Webhook Verification:</strong> Payment webhooks are cryptographically verified before processing — preventing forged payment confirmations.</li>
<li><strong>Input Sanitization:</strong> All user inputs are sanitized before processing to prevent injection attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Admin Access Control:</strong> Admin routes are protected by role-based authentication with separate authorization checks.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Per-user rate limiting via distributed cache protects against abuse and excessive API usage.</li>
</ul>
