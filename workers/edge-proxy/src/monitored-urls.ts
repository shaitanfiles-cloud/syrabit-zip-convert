/**
 * Task #887 — typed view of `monitored-urls.json`, the canonical registry
 * of every backend URL/path the worker (or its companion deploy infra)
 * hard-codes outside the FastAPI app.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * Task #877 was a 56-hour outage caused by `synthetic-probe.ts` hard-coding
 * `/admin/diagnostics` (no `/api` prefix) while the FastAPI router was
 * mounted under `prefix="/api"`. Every probe 404'd, the watchdog stayed
 * dark, and nobody noticed until someone scrolled production logs.
 *
 * The fix surface (Task #887) is the JSON manifest at
 * `workers/edge-proxy/monitored-urls.json` plus the pytest drift check
 * at `artifacts/syrabit-backend/tests/test_monitoring_url_drift.py` that
 * iterates the manifest and asserts every backend path resolves to a
 * real route in the live FastAPI OpenAPI schema. This module is the
 * runtime side: probes import the canonical strings from here so that
 * the value the test validates is *literally the same value* the worker
 * sends — no transcription drift between the manifest and the code.
 *
 * Task #900 extended the manifest to also cover the edge-cache config.
 * The `CACHEABLE_PREFIXES` / `CACHE_TTL` / `BYPASS_PREFIXES` /
 * `USER_SPECIFIC_PREFIXES` constants in `index.ts` are derived from this
 * module via the `getCacheable*` / `getBypass*` helpers below — so a
 * developer who renames a FastAPI route (e.g. `/api/content/boards` →
 * `/api/v2/content/boards`) gets a CI failure pointing at
 * `monitored-urls.json` instead of a silent cache miss in production.
 *
 * If you add a new probe / healthcheck / hard-coded backend URL anywhere
 * in this worker, register it in `monitored-urls.json` and reference it
 * from this module (or via `getBackendPath()` below). The drift test
 * gates merges; you cannot merge a hard-coded URL that is not in the
 * manifest if it ships through this module.

// the manifest into the shape `index.ts` consumes at runtime.
